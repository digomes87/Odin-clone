# Project: DESIGN YOUR OWN GRID-BASED FRAMEWORK
Introduction

In this final project, you’ll get to take everything you’ve learned and use it to build your own simple grid-based framework. As with the other final projects, we’ll keep it relatively open-ended to give you a chance to exercise your creativity and problem-solving skills. It will be a great project to show off to potential employers as well.

Once you’re done setting up your framework, you will use it to clone any website you like. If you’re out of ideas, try cloning The Odin Project!
